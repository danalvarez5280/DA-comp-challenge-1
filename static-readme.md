In this project I was tasked with re-creating a page, but making unique. The page is divided into a left and right half. The left will have different colored boxes with icons from the show Futurama. Each Icon is a link. When the window width is made smaller, the right half of the page will drop below the left. An icon will appear in the first box, it of course is another link. The page is responsive at the 1024px mark.

I don't know why these links aren't working. i have done the same format in the past and that worked.
